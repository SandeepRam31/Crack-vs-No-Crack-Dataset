# Crack-vs-No-Crack-Dataset

### How to use this:
* Run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
* Go inside code files and open gradcam.py
* Uncomment one of the 3 lines at the bottom of the file to predict on image, get highlights or predict on directory

### Summary
I have used a convolutional neural network to classify between crack and no crack images. The model has 5000+ parameters, hence trains really fast. 
I have also implemented Grad Cam, which allows us to visualize the place in the image where the crack is present.

Model:
